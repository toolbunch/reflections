When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate with somebody.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because pulling automatically may result in overwriting what I am working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone on github only. This is not a git feature but a github feature.
A clone is a copy of a repository. This coupd be a local clone, or a clone of a github repository.
A branch is a branch of the current edits that you are working on. It is a copy of all current, and changes made to the branch will not be reflected in main till merged.
